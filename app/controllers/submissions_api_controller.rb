# @API Submissions
#
# API for accessing and updating submissions for an assignment. The submission
# id in these URLs is the id of the student in the course, there is no separate
# submission id exposed in these APIs.
#
# All submission actions can be performed with either the course id, or the
# course section id. SIS ids can be used, prefixed by "sis_course_id:" or
# "sis_section_id:" as described in the API documentation on SIS IDs.

  #
  # Update the grading for a student's assignment submission.
  #
  # @argument submission[posted_grade] Assign a score to the submission,
  #   updating both the "score" and "grade" fields on the submission record.
  #   This parameter can be passed in a few different formats:
  #   points:: A floating point or integral value, such as "13.5". The grade will be interpreted directly as the score of the assignment. Values above assignment.points_possible are allowed, for awarding extra credit.
  #   percentage:: A floating point value appended with a percent sign, such as "40%". The grade will be interpreted as a percentage score on the assignment, where 100% == assignment.points_possible. Values above 100% are allowed, for awarding extra credit.
  #   letter grade:: A letter grade, following the assignment's defined letter grading scheme. For example, "A-". The resulting score will be the high end of the defined range for the letter grade. For instance, if "B" is defined as 86% to 84%, a letter grade of "B" will be worth 86%. The letter grade will be rejected if the assignment does not have a defined letter grading scheme. For more fine-grained control of scores, pass in points or percentage rather than the letter grade.
  #   "pass/complete/fail/incomplete":: A string value of "pass" or "complete" will give a score of 100%. "fail" or "incomplete" will give a score of 0.
  #
  #   Note that assignments with grading_type of "pass_fail" can only be
  #   assigned a score of 0 or assignment.points_possible, nothing inbetween. If
  #   a posted_grade in the "points" or "percentage" format is sent, the grade
  #   will only be accepted if the grade equals one of those two values.
  #
  # @argument rubric_assessment Assign a rubric assessment to this assignment
  #   submission. The sub-parameters here depend on the rubric for the
  #   assignment. The general format is, for each row in the rubric:
  #
  #   rubric_assessment[criterion_id][points]:: The points awarded for this row.
  #   rubric_assessment[criterion_id][comments]:: Comments to add for this row.
  #
  #   For example, if the assignment rubric is (in JSON format):
  #     [
  #       {
  #         'id': 'crit1',
  #         'points': 10,
  #         'description': 'Criterion 1',
  #         'ratings':
  #         [
  #           { 'description': 'Good', 'points': 10 },
  #           { 'description': 'Poor', 'points': 3 }
  #         ]
  #       },
  #       {
  #         'id': 'crit2',
  #         'points': 5,
  #         'description': 'Criterion 2',
  #         'ratings':
  #         [
  #           { 'description': 'Complete', 'points': 5 },
  #           { 'description': 'Incomplete', 'points': 0 }
  #         ]
  #       }
  #     ]
  #
  #   Then a possible set of values for rubric_assessment would be:
  #
  #   rubric_assessment[crit1][points]=3&rubric_assessment[crit2][points]=5&rubric_assessment[crit2][comments]=Well%20Done.
  #
  # @argument comment[text_comment] Add a textual comment to the submission.
